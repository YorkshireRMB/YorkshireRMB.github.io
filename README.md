# YorkshireRMB.github.io

This is a repo for an adventure in web development, using GitHub Pages to host a static site.

This webpage is going to show some pictures of cats, and maybe some other things.

## Working on the site locally

1. **Clone the repository**  
   If you haven't already, clone the repo to your local machine:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/YorkshireRMB/YorkshireRMB.github.io.git
   cd YorkshireRMB.github.io
   ```

2. **Make your changes**  
   Edit or add files as needed using your preferred editor.

3. **Preview your changes locally**  
   You can use a simple HTTP server to preview static sites. For example, with Python:
   ```sh
   # For Python 3.x
   python -m http.server
   ```
   Then open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser.

## Deploying changes to GitHub Pages

1. **Stage and commit your changes**
   ```sh
   git add .
   git commit -m "Describe your changes"
   ```

2. **Push your changes to GitHub**
   ```sh
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **View your live site**  
   After pushing, GitHub Pages will automatically update your site at:  
   [https://yorkshirermb.github.io/](https://yorkshirermb.github.io/)

> **Note:** It may take a minute or two for changes to appear live.
